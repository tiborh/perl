Masquerade

Leaves fall one by one on their own
as in the wind they are blown.
A variety of diversified hues
verify a season of change, a clue.

No more on the tree to give shade, 
what a beautiful masquerade.
leaves open to give shade and flourish
fall down upon the ground to nourish.

We start as a wee sprout, 
our lives begin to branch out.
A tree that blossoms and bears fruit
to have a solid foundation or root.

God yearns for us to grow
for the buds and fruit to flow, 
while seasons of life forever change
so weâ€™re able to live and interchange.
